# Project Summary

In this project, we'll create a node back-end for a DevMountain's swag shop. We'll make the back-end capable of registering users, logging in users, keeping track of guests, managing a shopping cart, and serving a pre-built React front-end. At the end of the project you'll be able to test your endpoints with Postman and the front-end.

## Step 1
